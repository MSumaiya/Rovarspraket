## Project Name: Rövarspråket Translator Project 

## Project Description

I created a simple web UI “Rövarspråket translator" using React
The user is able to enter text to be encoded or decoded into and from Rövarspråket
The user can also generate random jokes “joke of the day” from the given joke API - https://sv443.net/jokeapi/v2/

## Key features:

- A nice, self-contained component that is easy to configure.
- Completely responsive 
- Used Material UI for better design
- User can enter text in the input field and also can generate random joke in the same input field .
- User is able to encode the text and generated random joke.
- User is able to decode the encoded text or joke.
- Shows a good way to fetch API and error handling.
- Created separate reusable component for Button and input text field.
